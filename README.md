# Sentinel AMR Surveillance Platform

A comprehensive antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance platform built with Astro.js that standardizes and analyzes WHONET data for global health initiatives.

## Overview

The Sentinel platform provides a unified approach to AMR surveillance across human, animal, and environmental health sectors, following the One-Health paradigm.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Surveillance:** Unified approach across human, animal, and environmental health
- **Standardized Data:** Built on WHONET standards with enhanced validation and classification
- **WHO AWARE Integration:** Classification of antimicrobials according to WHO AWARE categories
- **Advanced Analytics:** Tools for detecting emerging resistance patterns

## Data Resources

- Organisms database with 2,946 standardized entries
- Comprehensive antimicrobials catalog with ATC codes
- WHO AWARE antimicrobial classifications
- Jupyter notebooks for data extraction and processing

## Technology

Built with:
- [Astro.js](https://astro.build) - The modern web framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - For styling with a teal color theme
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) - Data science notebooks for extraction and analysis

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Data Processing

The project includes several Jupyter notebooks for processing WHONET data:
- `Organisms_Extraction_Notebook_Fixed.ipynb` - Extract organism codes and metadata
- `ATC_CODE_EXTRACTION_NOTEBOOK.ipynb` - Extract antimicrobial ATC codes
- `WHO_AWARE_nANTIBIOTIC_CLASS_Extraction.ipynb` - Process WHO AWARE classifications
